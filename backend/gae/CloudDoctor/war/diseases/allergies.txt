Allergies
What Are the Symptoms of an Allergic Reaction?
Common symptoms of an allergic reaction to inhaled or skin allergens include:

Itchy, watery eyes
Sneezing
Itchy, runny nose
Rashes
Feeling tired or ill
Hives (a rash with raised red patches)
Other exposures can cause different allergic reactions:

Food allergies. An allergic reaction to food allergens can also cause stomach cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Insect stings. The allergic reaction to a sting from a bee or other insect causes local swelling, redness, and pain.
The severity of an allergic reactions symptoms can vary widely:

Mild symptoms may be almost unnoticeable, just making you feel a little off.
Moderate symptoms can make you feel ill, as if youve got a cold or even the flu.
Severe allergic reactions are extremely uncomfortable, even incapacitating.
Most symptoms of an allergic reaction go away shortly after the exposure stops.

The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. In anaphylaxis, allergens cause a whole body allergic reaction that can include:

Hives and itching all over (not just in the exposed area)
Wheezing or shortness of breath
Hoarseness or tightness in the throat
Tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or scalp
Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms can progress rapidly, so head for the emergency room if theres any suspicion of anaphylaxis.
